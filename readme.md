# TODO List

## Find ways to improve the current vinella FCIL

- GAN lr didn't work. 
- More complex classification head.
- server replay
- ACGAN integration.
- ImageNet-family dataset integration


- Understand how FedGTEA worked and plot a roadmap
- Code the initial version of FedGTEA


## Experiment Results
- GAN-lr and lr does not affect performances greatly, currently it's better to set them larger both at 1e-3
